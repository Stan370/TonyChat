Sure, let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Update the `Agent` interface in `agentManager.ts`**:
   - We added a new property called `conversations` to the `Agent` interface. This will store the chat messages for each agent.
   - The `conversations` property is an array of `OpenAIChatMessage` objects, which represent the messages in the chat.

2. **Update the `createAgent()` function in `agentManager.ts`**:
   - When a new agent is created, we initialize its `conversations` array with the first message (which is typically the system message).
   - This ensures that each agent has a starting point for their conversation history.

3. **Update the `sendMessage()` function in the `Chat` component**:
   - When the user sends a message, we first add the user's message to the current agent's `conversations` array.
   - Then, we call the API to get the assistant's response and add it to the current agent's `conversations` array as well.
   - Finally, we update the `conversations` state in the `Chat` component to reflect the changes.

4. **Update the `handleAgentClick()` function in the `Chat` component**:
   - When the user clicks on an agent, we retrieve the selected agent from the `agentManager` using the `getAgent()` function.
   - We then update the `conversations` state in the `Chat` component to display the selected agent's conversation history.

The key points in this process are:

1. Storing the conversation history for each agent in the `Agent` object.
2. Updating the agent's `conversations` array when a new message is sent.
3. Updating the `conversations` state in the `Chat` component to display the correct conversation history based on the selected agent.

By implementing this process, you can ensure that each agent has its own conversation history, and the user can switch between agents while retaining the appropriate chat context.
